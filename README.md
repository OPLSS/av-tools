# OPLSS Audio-Visual Club

This document describes the equipment and procedures we use to
video-record the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School
sessions. It also describes how we publish the recordings.

## A/V Equipment Inventory

We use the following audio-visual equipment to record each OPLSS session:

  * HD camcorder or digital SLR camera, plus its battery charger
  * tripod
  * wireless microphone (which the speaker wears)
  * headphones (to monitor the camera's audio input)
  * a set of rechargeable AA and AAA batteries, plus a charger
  * power strip (to charge batteries)
  * laser pointer
  * common HDMI video adapters
	* USB-C
    * Apple Thunderbolt

## Camera configuration

The camera should support all of the following configuration variables:

  * zoom
  * auto and manual focus
  * white balance
  * exposure compensation
  * video file format: MPEG-4, MOV, etc.

If the camera records in MPEG-4 format, it _may_ stop recording after 30
minutes. As such, each session will consume at least two and usually three files.

## A/V lead and Assistant

Jim should designate a primary audio-visual lead and an
assistant. The primary lead will be responsible for all aspects of
operating and maintaining the A/V equipment. The assistant should be
familiar with this document in order to record a session if the
primary is unavailable.

## Camera Operation Best Practices

This section summarizes best practices for operating the camera.

### Pre-OPLSS rehearsal

At least one week prior to the first OPLSS session, the camera
operator should arrange a time with Jim to visit the rooms where OPLSS
will take place and rehearse recording a session. This is vital to
understanding each room's layout, lighting, and A/V control systems.

In 2018, we used the two large classrooms in the Knight Law building,
rooms 110 and 175. Knight Law has a dedicated A/V staff person. Ensure
that Jim invites this person to the rehearsal so you can ask
questions. Jim should bring the camera, microphone, and tripod.

You should do all of the following during the rehearsal session:

  * Mount the camera on its tripod
  * Connect the wireless microphone and headphones to the camera
  * Record someone speaking with the wireless microphone
  * The wireless microphone *will* occasionally fail due to battery
    exhaustion, accidental power-off, interference, and other
    unexpected circumstances. Practice unplugging the microphone,
    recording with the camera's built-in mic, and reconnecting the 
  * Monitor the recording with headphones
  * Test cycling the room's A/V controls. Connect a laptop to the
    projector.

### Recording each session

Arrive at room at least 15 minutes prior to the session's start
time. Do all of the following during set-up:

  * Mount the camera to its tripod. Insert a fully-charged
    battery and charge the depleted battery.
  * Set the zoom, focus, white balance, and exposure compensation
  * Connect the wireless microphone and headphones. Power on the
    transmitter and check its battery level. If below 50%, replace the
    batteries.

Hand the transmitter to the speaker. If this is the speaker's first
session, offer the following advice:

  * The microphone is connected to the camera only, not the room's PA
    system. Speak at a normal lecture volume.
  * Attach the lapel clip to clothing between the neck and middle of the chest
  * Place the transmitter in a pocket or suspend from the belt clip
  * Please repeat questions asked by the audience

If the camera stops recording after 30 minutes, the A/V lead will
need to restart recording after it stops. I found it less stressful to
stop and start the recording by waiting for the speaker to pause. Do
this any time after the timer reaches 28 minutes.

#### Common problems and solutions

When the wireless microphone fails due to battery exhaustion and other
unexpected circumstances, immediately unplug it and continue recording
with the camera's built-in mic. If the batteries in the mic's receiver
exhaust themselves, replace them as quickly and quietly as possible,
then reconnect the mic. If the problem lies with the transmitter, *do
not* stop the speaker: instead, address the issue after the session.

### Storing the A/V equipment

We store the the A/V equipment in a secure location when the A/V lead
is not present.  In 2018 at the Knight Law building, we stored the
equipment in locked equipment closets connected to the classrooms. Jim
was responsible for managing the key. If this is the case in future
years, the lead should acquire the key from Jim as early as possible
before a session to retrieve the equipment.

## Video Publishing Procedures

We publish the videos to two locations:

  * The [University of Oregon's OPLSS site](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer18/topics.php)
  * The [`OPLSS` YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDe6N9R7U-RYWA57wzJQ2SQ)

### Publishing to the OPLSS site

Jim is the only person with credentials on the university's OPLSS
site. He does this every evening. The A/V lead should remove the
data card from the camera and give it to Jim at the conclusion of each
day's sessions. Likewise, the lead should retrieve the card from
Jim before recording the next day.

### Publishing to YouTube

Publishing the videos to YouTube is a complicated process involving
multiple software components and a considerable amount of manual effort.

#### Creating title graphics

The A/V lead should create title graphics to accompany the session
videos.  We refer to them here as "title cards" or "cards." We created
one set of cards that appear in every video, along with a set unique
to each session.

The common cards are:

  * main title
  * sponsors
  * copyright notice

The session cards state the topic, the speaker, the speaker's
affiliation, and the date.

In 2018, the A/V lead used GIMP to create the cards.

The OPLSS font is named [_PT Mono Bold_](https://www.1001fonts.com/pt-mono-font.html#character-map-bold), where "PT" is a reference to
"ParaType", the font's creator.

#### Generating the final videos

I used [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to combine the raw video files
and title graphics for each session into a single file suitable for
uploading to YouTube.

The elements appear in this sequence. The parenthesized number is the
element's length:

  * main card (6s)
  * sponsor card (6s)
  * session card (6s)
  * session videos (~90m)
  * copyright card (6s)
